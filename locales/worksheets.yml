      Whenever we are doing our work we shape our future and that of others.
      Whether we have such intention or even a particular outcome in mind the future never comes out exactly the way it was intended; reality takes place.
      But as some wise people say “it's not the dots but the arrows that matter” therefore, may we look forward to the journey and not a destination.

        What are possible solutions to the problem?
        Avoid thinking of limitations, or whether you're going to implement it, whether it's even possible.
        The only criteria for solutions at this step is it must solve the problem.

        Every solution comes to oneself and those around with costs and uncertainty.
        Costs beyond monetary or time and effort.
        Every path brings its learnings.
    instruction_1:
      en: |
        Looking at each solution, ask yourself:
        What can you learn from bringing this solution to life?
        Does it benefit the stakeholders?
        Does it place any burden on other stakeholders?
        Select one or two that will get you the best insight at the smallest cost and uncertainty.

        Describe the research to be done on an implemented solution. Answer the questions:
        How will you find out if the solution is not working?
        How can you get insight from the stakeholders?
        How can you keep your heart open to new stakeholders?

        Depending on the scale and your research question it is important to choose the right means and scope for delivering the solution.
        The fidelity can be anything: paper prototype, service prototype, mockup, interactive prototype, a coded prototype, phone call or presentation, limited release of software, etc.
