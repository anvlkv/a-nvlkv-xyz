        ### UX design

        In my process of user experience design, I start by familiarizing myself with the domain and the experiences of those working in the domain. 

        Aiming to get the most in-depth insights from new or potential users, I conduct interviews, and study all available artifacts. If there's an opportunity for a field study, like a shadowing session or walking a mile in their shoes, I better take it.

        I also rely on insights gathered from support, development, and others involved with the product, learning about potential weak points or common confusions.

        Arriving at the problem statement, I seek confirmation that any given problem is worthy of solving in the current development stage of the product. I take strategic (where we want to be in the future) and tactical (what can we do now to bring the future closer) perspectives.

        During ideation, I like to use what's already out there, be it in the existing product or otherwise within the team's reach. Where necessary, I provide a contrasting alternative or solutions at a different level.

        I use the first iteration of proposed solutions as a conversation starter, helping me to find shared understanding with stakeholders and developers of a problem we're solving.

        In the following iterations, the more refined solutions are tested with non-involved users and include proof of concept for technical feasibility (if the design poses any technical challenges).

        One may view software as an ever-evolving sophisticated prototype which keeps changing slightly or greatly with iterations. Continuously measuring and monitoring the change in user behavior helps me uncovering issues and growth opportunities.

          ### Web development

          My approach to web development is very user-oriented. While my web development experience naturally stems from my [experience as a designer](/expertise/ux-design), and therefore, more front-end focused, I firmly believe no UI is the best UI. Interfaces are a necessity in achieving users' goals or driving their attention, yet interfaces are not the goal. The goal is to get the job done for the user.

          I apply the <abbr>MAYA</abbr>(Most Advanced Yet Acceptable) design principle when choosing technologies for any specific implementation. Concerning web development, Acceptable means more than just browser support, but also taking the user's context into account, how it will play out with existing integrations, and many more depending on project specifics.

          Web development, perhaps, like any other software, means inevitably using 3-rd party solutions. I'm carefully choosing those, making my judgment based on documentation, source code, usage, and known issues information if available. 

          Being a designer-developer,  I'm paying a great deal of attention to accessibility, error prevention, and handling.

          Natural curiosity drives my passion to try new tools and frameworks and maybe apply them where appropriate.

          Through multiple iterations, I organize code for reusability and systemic view, arranging a living design system.

          ### Project management

          My approach to managing projects is to establish a common understanding of a subject with the team and stakeholders.

          I atomize tasks and find time, budget constraints, and dependencies. 

          Working with others, I value their unique backgrounds and perspectives, encourage an atmosphere of co-creation, and hold space for those who need it.

          I facilitate design and refinement events, and point out and discuss issues in the process.

          ### Mobile design

          My experience with native mobile design is less extensive than [web and UX design](/expertise/ux-design).

          I rely on platform design guidelines and universal digital design knowledge.

          At the same time, mobile context is my first consideration when designing for the web, as it comes with its benefits and constraints.

          I certainly look forward to doing more for the mobile medium.
