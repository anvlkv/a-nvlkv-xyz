Picket navigator is an app for pipeline engineers and servicemen. It allowed inspection of existing pipelines and projects in the field and at the office.

Building the picket navigator we collaborated closely with developers and our client's DB engineer. We analyzed multiple pipelines, which brought up several visualization challenges like changes in the landscape and density of pipeline features.

I created interactive prototypes and tested them with our customer. We later prepared the app for a field test.

Finalizing my work on picket navigator I designed an integration with external equipment allowing more precision in the field work.
