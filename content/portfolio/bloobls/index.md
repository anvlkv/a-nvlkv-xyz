Bloobls was intended as an educational game. Our team only made one level, which we presented at Winter Nights. Sadly we had to part with our founder.

Working on this project I couldn't insist more on early testing of the concept. However, we got highly polished first level that satisfied our main stakeholder. The tests were done at the conference, on rather adult audience.

At the time there wasn't an easily accessible solution for session recording, so we implemented our own recording of screen and user-facing camera.
