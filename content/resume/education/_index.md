### Education

I'm a genuinely curious person. A lot of my learning happens in much smaller chunks: I learn from my experimentation, hands-on experience, research, docs, and examples. 

Aiming to systematize and further improve my knowledge I often take relevant courses.

My specialized education starts from nursing, transitions to fashion design, and later software development and design.
