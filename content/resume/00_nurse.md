During my school years and in preparation for medical education, I completed an examination practice as a junior nurse at my hometown's emergency hospital. This experience provided invaluable insight into the healthcare field and allowed me to make an informed decision about my career path.
While I enjoyed the personalities of more experienced nurses, I ultimately chose for a different career path.
