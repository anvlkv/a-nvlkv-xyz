#### Designer, user experience engineer, full-stack developer

In my professional journey, I've embraced a variety of roles and perspectives. Even when focused on one discipline, I maintain a curiosity about how others experience my work. My best tool in work and study is empathy, allowing me to find meaningful and deliverable solutions, and learn from my teachers as if in person.

I also empathize deeply with the materials, mediums, and individuals I work with. My empathy is forensic, leading me to explore source code, research W3C discussions and drafts, or study activity logs to gain a comprehensive understanding.

My approach is holistic. Through desk study, interviews, and experimentation, I learn the problem area, stakeholders, users, customers, competition, and other forces. Basing my design and implementation decisions on both technical and domain-specific knowledge.
