Upon college graduation, I commenced my career at a renowned local designer's studio, primarily focusing on men's wear collections and catering to private customer orders. Created constructional designs and conducted fittings, ensuring the quality and precision of the clothing.
Our team expanded, and we embarked on a project to create casual wear for football fans of the local team ZENIT. Took charge of constructional design, technical illustration, and technical documentation, ensuring the seamless execution of the project. Established effective communication channels between suppliers and the quality assurance team, guaranteeing the production met high standards.
