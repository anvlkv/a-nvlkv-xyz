As a UX engineer and developer, I've woven a path through various media and technology, crafting authentic user experiences.

My expertise lies in information architecture, systems thinking, UX engineering, and development, with a foresightful strategic approach.

Equipped with empathy, I strive to understand the problems and motivations of customers, businesses, and other entities. My research approach combines desk study and hands-on engagement, incorporating qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods.

## Case studies and work experience

My process involves data modeling, prototyping, proof of concept, testing workflows, and researching technical feasibility. It enables more insightful user tests, bringing to life robust and meaningful solutions.

Extensive development experience, which grew out of the desire for fine control of my designs and understanding of the digital medium, allows me to bridge the gap between creative concepts and technical execution and,  more importantly, communicate with professionals from different fields. On my journey, I'm committed to quality and precision, whether in the design, implementation, or management of projects. Each experience has added a unique thread to my holistic approach.
