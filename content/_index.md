As a communication artist I enjoy working across different media and technology to foster genuine conversations.

This particular website is my small _meta medium_ experiment in generative storytelling using entered autobiography facts. It uses `diffusers` and `kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2` model to illustrate bio entries. 

I trust everyone's story is best heard than envied, and therefore I share my [story](/bio) and [my code](https://gist.github.com/anvlkv/fe49c2f168d481b9abc19107cc603e58) openly. Hoping for us to live in the world where we have time for each other.
