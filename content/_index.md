As a communication artist I enjoy working across different media and technology to foster genuine conversations.

I aspire to promote peace and harmony in our world through my work.

Embracing my self-taught journey, I highly value the diverse backgrounds and unique experiences that other individuals bring to the table. 

I'm proficient in UX and interactive design across multiple platforms, front-end and full-stack software development, along with a flair for textile art, and graphic design. 

My approach is best described as evolutionary, artistic, hands-on engagement, systems thinking, and R&D. I prioritize functionality and robustness over appearance, firmly believing that the best aesthetic qualities emerge from transforming chaos into order.

As humans, our greatest strength lies in our ability to learn, and I find immense joy in the ceaseless pursuit of knowledge:)

My hobbies are yoga, hiking, languages, analog photography.
