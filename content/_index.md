As a UX engineer and developer, I've woven a path through various media and technology, crafting authentic user experiences.

### Case studies and work experience

My expertise lies in information architecture, systems thinking, UX engineering, and development, with a foresightful strategic approach.

Equipped with empathy, I strive to understand the problems and motivations of customers, businesses, and other entities. My research approach combines desk study and hands-on engagement, incorporating qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods.

My further process involves data modeling, prototyping, proof of concept, testing workflows, and researching technical feasibility. It enables more insightful user tests, bringing to life robust and meaningful solutions.
