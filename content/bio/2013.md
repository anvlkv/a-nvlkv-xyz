Around that time I tried Instagram and read more about their choice of square images, polaroids, and medium format photography. I picked up MF film photography as my hobby and bought a Soviet copy of Hasselblad - Kiev 88. I was pleased to see my first analogous pictures, less so to find my camera jams the film now and then. I got my favorite camera since then the Mamiya RB-67. It made 10 precious shoots and the roll had to be developed and scanned, making it pricy to take pictures which I was less sure about. I loved the constraint of being able to take just a few images as it promoted some spark of mindfulness before pressing the button. I wanted to share the inspiration with my friends, who I knew were comfortable with professional cameras. I made a few bids for Kodak Aerochrome film, we've got two rolls and shared two shoots each on each film.
