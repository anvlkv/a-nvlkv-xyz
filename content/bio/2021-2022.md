Back at the office new developers were joining our team, I was onboarding them with the codebase, discussing the practices we want to use, and delivering my features and designs for the new ones. As it goes in Alan Cooper's "Inmates are Running the Asylum," my first book on UX design, only then I realized in what conflicted position I put myself in, as it made it difficult to speak of new UI patterns and features, yet defend the consistency and quick deliverability of the results. I was getting burnt out, not only with work, but I was good at turning everything into work, doing things that were bringing fun and pleasure even when I didn't want to, and trying to bring about progress and improvement in my artistic skills. I asked to change my role at work to one of a designer, proposing myself as a UXE but we needed a product designer.
