A different project came this time and I became a project manager. We did online quizzes and localisations of movie websites for the CIS division of a famous animation company. We later took on more of their websites including the one of the tv-channel, CMS, and some of the generic services they used across all websites. During this project, I had to tell someone they were fired, despite all the beers we've had. I still don't find it very acceptable to use a text file in place of a database in production. I at the same time regret this my whole time since then, as it was favoring me and my boyfriend over his family. Our team then grew with more developers and improved the process with the help of our CTO. I've also turned more to the developers' side now advocating for them and finding time to get to their level of detail. I learned git, operating our docker infrastructure, build systems and more, I could fix or at least get necessary information outside of their working hours, sometimes working with them when we had an overnight release.
