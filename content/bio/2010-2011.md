I later took a more extensive CAD course and landed my first job in Leonid Alexeev's design studio. I enjoyed our first projects, I made patterns for jerseys following his designs, and we made suits for private orders. The studio took a larger order to make casual wear for the FC Zenit. The production was to be done in China. With a new colleague who had some experience working on such a project, we made two seasons of jerseys, knitwear, trousers, and jackets. My Adobe Illustrator skill improved greatly, I made patterns and measurement lists, set up our office network so that we can exchange files, and made samples and documentation that we sent to our suppliers. This continued for a year, but I came to realize that my overall impression of the fashion industry along with the audience was as toxic, boring, or rather deeply bored, humiliating, and such a waste of resources that I turned to my newly gained interest in computers and supposedly less resource intensive ways of creation.
