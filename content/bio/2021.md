Lockdown at home with my boyfriend brought much introspection and made me realize how much not at home I was feeling. I made a wearable art piece. I made laser cut stencils with evacuation signs, spray painted fabric, and sawn a coat. It was a pleasure to realize the skill I had only got just slightly rusty. I experimented more, with different fabrics and batik techniques, learning to let the dyes flow conveying the nature of the material, or stop them with wax. After the lockdown, despite the far going plans we split with my boyfriend.
