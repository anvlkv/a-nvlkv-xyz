I looked for more freelance orders, but soon, a man I dated during college times, invited me to join a project team of O.F.I.S. which intended to make universal pages for small-scale entrepreneurs. I thought it might be a problem to join your ex's team, but I was sure I'll do my best to keep my distance. I made my first mockups in Illustrator but also had a chance to learn HTML and CSS, which turned SASS almost instantly. My next mockups were static pages. iOS and its skeuomorphism were around, so my boss challenged me with a skeuomorphic design implemented in pure CSS. I learned a lot about how browser paints and the why's behind it by reading W3C docs and published discussions. The project never saw the world as one day he decided to make games instead. Rather surprised I stayed as it was a job and I was still learning a lot.
