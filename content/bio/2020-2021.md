I found remote work more beneficial as it naturally placed all the communication online where it was within my reach every time. Our team found a multitude of means for online collaboration and was inspired by them as well. I was also enjoying my superpower to focus for hours, which came back to me once the office distractions were off. At the same time, my focus at work moved to implementing UI library components, filling the gap between our past developments and new architecture.
