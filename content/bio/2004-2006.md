I thought I was going to pursue medical education. I had a  Psychiatry magazine subscription. Being a lonely kid I even came up with an imaginary narcissistic friend, who would cheer me up when preparing for biology and chemistry exams. During the last two years of school, I took nursing courses and passed examinational practice in emergency hospital â„–1 as a junior nurse. It made one of the best summers, other nurses were fun to talk with and I felt I was doing something helpful. I also, realized that I wouldn't want to work in healthcare, as it wouldn't benefit my personality to see people suffering as my daily job.
