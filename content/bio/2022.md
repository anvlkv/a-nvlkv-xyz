An old friend, whom I always knew as an artist, whose paintings seemed to reflect the deepest of my inexpressible feelings, became my life partner on this new journey into artistic life. I planned to continue the designer's day job while working with him on our artistic project ideas. Trying to live up to a new role everywhere wasn't such a brilliant idea. I lost my yoga practice, there wasn't much fulfillment from any work I did. My friend suggested I try rug tufting. I got a cheap loop-pile tufting gun and a frame. Physically intensive, loud, and completely new for me, the rug tufting became an outlet, where I could go on for a while with low expectations from myself. We dreamed up the twopack.gallery project. At home, I started experimenting with ideas for the online representation of the gallery: looking at the technologies used by generative artists, which made their work available on the web and in the physical world, brought great inspiration. 

As twopack.gallery we hope to encourage and facilitate artistic collaboration and exchange across different media and geography. We believe it's the artist in every human, who can make this world a better place.

With my partner, we started our move to Chiang Mai, Thailand, where we want to work on our project and one day open a physical gallery and co-creation space for local artists. We are far from our dream at this point but already open to artistic collaboration.
