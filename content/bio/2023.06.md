I believe more than ever that every person on Earth, and this is where I live, is equally important. Just like me, none deserve to be privileged or an authority, blinded by their ego. There're no bad people but the sum of experiences they've been through, their circumstances. Systems of subsystems with recursive loops. Relative and Absolute. Not the dots but the arrows that matter. The whole and it's every aspect. I believe artists in each of us must co-create a harmonious and peaceful world, where we want to live in.
