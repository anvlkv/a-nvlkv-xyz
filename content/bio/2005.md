A friend of mine, who was already studying psychology at the time, picked up photography as a hobby, we planned to take some shoots in a forest. I made us costumes, which seemed to me like a fun process. I later made a few more, much inspired by Anna Varney from the Sopor Aeternus and The Ensemble of Shadows. Being short on time, as I changed my course and had to choose for which kind of entry exams to prepare, I thought, fashion design could be my thing, as I liked working with fabric and drawing. To my huge disappointment at the time, my academic drawing skills weren't there, not even after a year of taking a course, at least that was my judgment when I looked at the examples. So I looked for something a little more practical, at the same time accepting that formal degrees won't matter much in my view of life.
