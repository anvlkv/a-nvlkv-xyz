Looking for a new job, I took more courses on user experience design and joined a software studio DDG. We made solutions for business automation. My first projects were mobile apps for local taxi operators or beauty clinic staff. It was fun, I felt more secure about the business where I'm working. I was also learning a lot about development and design for different platforms.

My first big project was an app for pipeline engineers. Together with the client's db engineer we analysed several pipelines and picked a few to use in mockups. I made mockups of an Android app showing different views on a real pipeline, and linked up the screens in PDF, with some changes on board we started the development. Through several revisions of the app and the prototype, I was discussing user experience and our design with the client, together with the team preparing the app for a field test. The test brought up many improvements to our design and implementation, which gave me a chance to practice creating Android layouts in XML code. We also designed an integration with external equipment.
