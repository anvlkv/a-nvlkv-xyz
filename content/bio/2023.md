At the same time, I realized more and more that I need to focus on my artistic pursuits instead. I came up with a way of organizing the time for my artistic work and hopefully finding supporters. I started “the work in progress” - podcast by twopack.gallery, where I would show my creative process in fine detail, whatever I'm doing, coding, painting, or sewing. I created the first two episodes using Remotion. The prototype worked not smoothly at all. The second prototype had to deal with a much greater length of video and was a complete rewrite. Extremely slow, the second episode took a week to render on my laptop, thanks to my stubbornness in not using AWS. Recording the third episode I implemented a proof of concept in ffmpeg-rust, switched to gstreamer, and with advice from the community to gstreamer editing services. I hope to help myself and other DIYers who want to share the fun of making.
