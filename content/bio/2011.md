I started learning web and graphics design in my free time also inspired by my boyfriend who was a programmer. All tutorials were focused on Photoshop but I figured Illustrator is my saviour and stick with that. The CAD GRAFIS allowed programmable macros, so my last collars were code generated and I got my taster of programming. Once I had my first paid freelance project I left the studio. The project was not what I hoped for visually, but a detailed prototype of an intranet help page for a telecom company made in Axure RP.
