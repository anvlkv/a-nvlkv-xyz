This last project brought me enough money to live with my boyfriend and pay for his master's and our English school, he could leave his programmer job and study urban design. I took courses on UX, HCD, HCI, CS, communication science, and more. I returned to yoga classes to cope with that. Yoga helped me a great deal but also to realize there’s more than work in my life. 

At home we thought up an app for urban studies, I took interviews from some of his group, made a simple prototype, and even started coding some front-end. But this time it didn’t work to keep a distance between work and life so we stopped with the project. 

Things at home were getting tense, and even more so with my attempts to end the relationship. From my teenage suicide attempts I knew my body was difficult to kill and only got myself infected with HIV. Doctor who informed me about the diagnosis told me with Russian healthcare I’d have about 15 years. I felt a sudden urge to do something meaningful with my life, this was one of the best transformative moments. The news about HIV didn’t make my boyfriend leave me. He found a PhD position in the Netherlands and we moved.
