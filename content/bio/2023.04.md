Along with the day job it came very demanding on my time and energy, I tried GitHub Copilot and loved it. It was like I suddenly had a dumb older brother, who would do a lot of work for me in a second, yet I could discard my code without too much attachment. It made me feel brave enough to study video formats and the editing process much deeper, which I never thought I would.

While working on this very project you're looking at I tried python and hugging face APIs to categorize entries and generate the imagery. I trust everyone's story is a fascinating journey if they feel brave enough to share, and I hope to give an example with this little project.
