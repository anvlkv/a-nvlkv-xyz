My cousin moved to Saint Petersburg, so I was naturally looking for a study there. I found just quite the description I was looking for. The High School of Fashion and Applicable Arts - formally a technical college. We studied sketching, pattern making, textile, and technology, this is also where I learned about batik. Each of us could go from a blank sheet of paper to a well-fit coat. Sadly, once there was an inspection of the college and my friend and I filed a complaint, explaining it's cold in the study rooms and there's nowhere to eat at lunchtime other than Georgian restaurant, super yum but we were just students. We may have hoped to change things but we closed our college instead. This made me quite ashamed, for a long time I wasn't even showing up in my beloved area of the city and came up with self-accusing jokes. My group and I still graduated but our last year was in a different place. During my whole study, I made some clothes and even took private orders, and I was happy to try anything saying its at my own risk; I did suits for men and women, dresses and coats, overalls, a wedding dress. For my graduation project, I was the one using CAD for a collection of suits. 

Lacking what I thought was a normal family in my childhood and realizing myself as a homosexual I tried to meet someone via dating sites. Some were creeps, some were like me, and all were looking to feel someone close.
