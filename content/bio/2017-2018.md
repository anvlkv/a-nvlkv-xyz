Inspired by my job, Angular community, and life in the new country I took up more learning. At home, I was learning TDD with Angular and even made karma-hue-reporter which would adjust the lights according to passing or failing tests. I tried to get a taste of having a pet project of my own and started looking into designing my own programming language and environment. Which brought me to learning rust as my first systemic language.

I was encouraged by our director to also study systems thinking and disruptive innovation. I took courses, and read books and publications on systems thinking. I organized with people from our several teams, drawing individual system diagrams of our product and how it solves a real-world problem. My diagram focused on the efficient communication of LCA study results through our software, presenting the communication system. This cross-team activity outlined the system of subsystems people in the company saw in itself and its product.

My yoga and meditation practice also improved a great deal, thanks to Ashtanga yoga classes and all the yoga teachers publishing their lessons for free. I engaged more with Buddhist philosophy.
