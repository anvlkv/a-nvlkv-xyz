At work, now as team Mozgy, we started working on his idea of an entertainment app, it was supposed to show short and funny stories with illustrations (like memes but paid). I studied iOS guides and made several designs, there was even a version made from colored plasticine, which I photographed part by part in different states and then edited together, for once Photoshop was helpful. I was starting to make contacts with potential story writers and illustrators but there came another change of course. We hired a game designer, later, together with her two programmers and two illustrators. It was going to be an educational game. Once we were done with level 1 with all the smooth animations and pretty graphics, we started planning a test. I suggested implementing screen and camera recording for testing purposes. We demoed the game at the Winter Nights conference, but it didn't get much attention. Without any more testing, the project came to an end. I was the one to inform our team. A year later we were all to see our founder's name is on the local newspaper, he's being put in jail and accused of pedophilia.
